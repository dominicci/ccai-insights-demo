      "text": "I understand. Unfortunately, because the tires were mounted, and the shoes show evidence of use, we are unable to accept the return. Items that have been installed and used, like tires that have been on a rim and shoes that have been ridden in, cannot be returned. In your case, the tires are considered used because of the fact that they were mounted to wheels. The shoes, being ridden in, will have cleat marks on the soles, and would no longer be considered new. Similarly, your tires likely have dirty tires and we cannot resell them as new. We only accept returns for items in brand new, unused condition.",
