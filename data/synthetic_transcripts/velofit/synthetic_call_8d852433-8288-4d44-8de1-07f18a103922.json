Just pack the VeloBand Pulse securely in its original packaging, if possible, attach the label, and drop it off at any authorized carrier location. Once we receive the returned item, we'll process your refund. You should see the refund credited back to your account within 7-10 business days. As a point of reference, it's different from returning a smart watch, which may need additional protection.",
