Unfortunately, because the tires have been mounted and the shoes have visible cleat marks, indicating they have been used, we are unable to accept the return. Items must be in new, unused condition to be eligible for a return. Once tires have been installed, the dirty tires prevent us from accepting them back as new. Similarly, shoes with cleat marks and evidence of use, we cannot resell. Our return policy, which can be found on our website, details these conditions.",
